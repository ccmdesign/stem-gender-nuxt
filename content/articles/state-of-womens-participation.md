### The importance of women's participation and leadership in STEM.
<p class="dropcap" data-letter="I">
In investigating local trends in women's participation in STEM, IDRC-funded research has highlighted challenges similar to those reported in the Global North. Across various regions, women's participation and leadership in STEM fields have not kept pace with the rapid growth of STEM industries and broader advancements toward gender equality (UNESCO, 2017).
</p>

Alarmingly, despite increasing representation of women in higher education throughout the Americas and Europe, significant attrition occurs as women transition from STEM education to the workforce and even into advanced levels of education (European Commission, 2021; National Science Foundation, 2021).

Recent studies reveal that while female engagement in STEM research averages around 40% in regions like Latin America, the Caribbean, and parts of Europe, it remains lower in North America and Western Europe, hovering around 30% (UIS, 2019). This disparity underscores the need for targeted interventions to support women at critical transition points in their STEM careers. We highlight other major trends and statistics below.

## Barriers to participation and leadership
These challenges are not isolated incidents but are part of a broader pattern that has been extensively documented. Research from the Breaking Barriers Network, a collaborative effort at understanding and addressing these obstacles, has uncovered several key issues:
::


#### Gender Stereotypes and Societal Norms
Gender stereotypes significantly influence the perception of which STEM-related jobs are deemed appropriate for women and men. These stereotypes often limit women's career aspirations and discourage them from pursuing or advancing in STEM fields. Societal expectations and traditional roles, particularly in patriarchal communities, create additional barriers by reinforcing beliefs that women are less suited for technical and scientific professions. For instance, the notion that STEM fields are inherently masculine can deter women from entering or persisting in these careers, as they may internalize these beliefs or face external discouragement.

#### Lack of Role Models and Mentorship
The scarcity of female role models and mentors in STEM fields contributes to the underrepresentation of women in these areas. Without visible and accessible female scientists and leaders, young women may lack the inspiration and guidance necessary to pursue STEM careers. This absence is evident in academic settings, where female faculty members and researchers are underrepresented, and in professional environments where women's contributions are less recognized. Additionally, the lack of structured mentorship programs exacerbates this issue, as women may miss out on valuable guidance and networking opportunities that are critical for career development.

#### Educational Barriers
Educational environments often fail to support women effectively, impacting their confidence and interest in STEM subjects. Gender biases in teaching practices and curricula can undermine women's self-esteem and academic performance in subjects like mathematics and science. Social and educational contexts may perpetuate the belief that women are less capable in these areas, which can lead to lower self-confidence and reduced participation. Furthermore, the intimidation of entering male-dominated academic spaces and the potential for hostile or exclusionary behaviors can deter women from pursuing advanced studies or careers in STEM. Limited training opportunities in technical subjects related to emerging green industries also restrict women's career progression and access to leadership roles.

#### Workplace Barriers
Women in STEM often encounter significant obstacles in the workplace, including the undervaluation of their technical skills. This bias can manifest in fewer opportunities for career advancement, recognition, and participation in high-impact projects. Gender-based discrimination and harassment, such as inappropriate comments and exclusion from key meetings or decision-making processes, further contribute to a challenging work environment. Additionally, a lack of institutional policies and resources to support women's career development—such as flexible work arrangements, pay equity, and career development programs—can hinder their professional growth and retention.

#### Cultural and Social Barriers
Cultural norms and practices can severely restrict women's participation in STEM fields. For example, in some regions, traditional views on land ownership and gender roles limit women's involvement in agricultural sciences and other STEM-related areas. Cultural expectations regarding women's primary roles in domestic responsibilities and familial obligations can also constrain their ability to engage in STEM careers. These cultural practices often intersect with societal attitudes that view women's contributions as less valuable, further perpetuating their marginalization.

#### Policy and Institutional Barriers
National and institutional policies frequently lack integration of gender considerations, resulting in insufficient support for women in STEM. Many existing policies do not adequately address the specific needs and challenges faced by women, leading to ineffective implementation and limited impact. For example, policies may fail to promote gender diversity in recruitment, advancement, and leadership roles within STEM organizations. The lack of enforcement of gender equity guidelines and the absence of dedicated resources to implement supportive measures further exacerbate these barriers. Effective policy integration is essential for creating environments that support and sustain women's participation and leadership in STEM.

## Responding to UNESCO's Call to Action to Close the Gender Gap in Science
::

IDRC's **Breaking Barriers Network** reflects only a snapshot of the global movement to bridge the gender gap on women's participation and success in STEM. There has been a growing awareness among the international community of the importance of gender equality in STEM. Various organizations, governments, and advocacy groups have been actively working to promote gender diversity and inclusion in these fields. 
A key moment for this community has been the launch of UNESCO's 2024 call to action entitled ["Closing the Gender Gap in Science."](https://dataviz.unesco.org/en/science-technology-and-innovation/cta) While this call emphasizes the importance of gender equality in addressing complex global challenges, it also highlighted the significant gaps that exist, which map directly onto many of the systemic and systematic barriers that IDRC's research collaborators have confronted and identified to date.
The call to action proposed three strategic areas of intervention, each with a set of recommendations and potential actions. The three areas of intervention are: 

1.	Dismantling gender stereotypes and biases in science through increased visibility of role models.
2.	Opening educational pathways for girls in science through innovative educational strategies and initiatives.
3.	Creating workplace environments that attract, retain, and advance women scientists through policies and actions that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

One of the main goals of UNESCO's call to action is to mobilize the scientific community to advance gender equality in science. This requires a solid foundation of evidence and knowledge that can inform effective policies and practices. A research agenda that is responsive to the needs and contexts of different regions and disciplines is essential to support the implementation of the call to action.  

In alignment with this vision, IDRC's investments to identify and address barriers facing women in STEM in the Global South have been pivotal. As IDRC-funded projects conclude and further findings emerge, a community of global scholars has answered this call to action. Here, we present a snapshot of the evidence base generated by the **Breaking Barriers Network** that only moves us closer to building bridges to women's participation and success in STEM.
