Through the Breaking Barriers network, IDRC is advancing its efforts to address systemic and systematic barriers to women's participation and leadership in STEM. With projects focused on specific research modalities, contexts, scales, and even STEM disciplines, teams are effectively addressing different challenges and issues and uncovering areas of future research and collaboration. 

## Building Gender-Responsive and Equitable STEM Institutions

Projects from across the Breaking Barriers Network have worked diligently to begin to institutionalize gender-responsive policies that promote equity and inclusivity within STEM institutions. Formal mentorship programs have been developed to support women in fields such as engineering, agronomic sciences, green industries, and water management. These programs connect emerging female scientists with experienced mentors, offering them critical resources, guidance, and encouragement to navigate their STEM careers. Additionally, the projects have established and supported scholarship and incentive programs to motivate women to pursue STEM studies and recognize their academic achievements, ensuring ongoing participation in research and innovation. 

To foster greater gender equity in university settings, one of our projects in Zimbabwe introduced gender audits in both academic and workplace environments. These audits assess institutional practices and policies to identify gender disparities and improve accountability. Gender mainstreaming strategies were also put in place, ensuring that equity is embedded in the organizational culture and that gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination are actively prevented. These efforts have created safer, more inclusive environments where women can thrive, free from systemic barriers.

### What's needed?
A focus on evaluating existing gender-responsive policies at national and institutional levels, identifying gaps and areas for improvement to ensure alignment with national science priorities. There is a need to explore the impact of advocacy efforts on women's representation in leadership and decision-making roles within STEM, generating evidence to support policy refinement.

## Leveraging Data to Address Gender Disparities

Given an increasing acknowledgement of the lack of gender-based data to support interventions in this space, some projects have prioritized data-driven approaches to understanding and addressing gender disparities in STEM. Projects have established comprehensive data collection and digitalization efforts in countries such as South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Some projects, such as our project in South Africa, is using gender-responsive methodologies to gather gender-disaggregated data on women's participation in STEM fields, identifying barriers and critical points of attrition, such as during transitions from education into the workforce.

Existing data collection efforts go beyond gathering statistics; projects like the ELLAS Network are building institutionalized systems that allow universities and research bodies to continuously monitor progress. This gender-disaggregated data provides the foundation for developing evidence-based policies that directly address gender inequalities. Furthermore, by integrating gender analysis into STEM research across disciplines, we are uncovering valuable insights into how gender dynamics influence STEM success, contributing to more informed and effective policy interventions. In West Africa, particularly in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, and Niger, participatory research methods such as Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) were used to gather insights from women farmers and develop gender-sensitive research approaches. These methods ensured that women's perspectives were included in agricultural data collection, addressing gender disparities embedded in research methodologies.

Some projects are beginning to develop digital platforms, as these also play a key role in promoting gender equality. By showcasing the contributions of women in traditionally male-dominated fields such as agriculture and ICT, these platforms help enhance visibility and recognition of women's roles in STEM, while contributing to a larger body of evidence needed to advocate for policy changes.

### What's needed?
We must prioritize the collection and analysis of comprehensive data on the factors contributing to attrition and low participation rates among marginalized groups in STEM, focusing on existing mechanisms and platforms for institutional and national-level data collection. Future efforts should examine high-risk moments for dropout across the educational spectrum and during transitions into the workforce, aiming to develop targeted interventions based on empirical findings to address these critical gaps.

## Fostering Leadership and Mentorship for Women in STEM

The Network has made significant progress in creating leadership and mentorship pathways for marginalized women, who are often excluded from decision-making and research leadership roles. In Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan, the East African Supervision and Mentorship Framework was co-designed by key stakeholders with the aim of strengthening the connection between the women researchers and mentors. These programs not only provide women with the technical skills they need to succeed, but also build their confidence and leadership capacities, enabling them to participate in research agenda-setting and policy development.

Teams have also fostered partnerships with advocacy groups and networks, such as the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World, the Ghana Institution of Engineering, and Women in STEM Ghana. These collaborative networks offer platforms for women to share best practices, resources, and mentorship opportunities. Through these networks, we have been able to scale our efforts and establish regional platforms that support female researchers, enhancing their access to leadership opportunities across academic, research, and industry settings.

In addition, leadership programs have emphasized the need for intersectionality, ensuring that women from diverse backgrounds, including those from marginalized and underrepresented communities, are prioritized in leadership and mentorship initiatives. This inclusivity ensures that decision-making processes in STEM are reflective of a wide range of voices and experiences. PEPMI acknowledged this gap in intersectional thinking at the university level, developing a scholarship program directly targeting Indigenous women otherwise unable to pursue studies in STEM in Mexico. 

### What's needed?
Explore the effectiveness of mentorship frameworks in supporting women, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in STEM fields. Future efforts should assess the impact of partnerships with advocacy organizations and digital platforms in enhancing mentorship connections, as well as investigate leadership training programs that equip women with the necessary skills and confidence to assume decision-making roles.

## Ensuring Support Across Education and Career Pathways

Projects have begun to develop coordinated, multi-level support system to help women transition successfully from STEM education into the workforce. At the educational level, one project has developed curriculum revisions to ensure gender equity is embedded in learning materials and teaching practices. Other projects are promoting capacity-building initiatives for lecturers and university staff emphasize gender-sensitivity training and the adoption of gender-responsive pedagogies. These efforts create inclusive learning environments where women are not only encouraged to participate, but also given tailored support that addresses their unique challenges.

At the policy level, certain projects have been instrumental in shaping national frameworks such as the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) Policy and the Education Strategic Plan in Zimbabwe, which emphasize gender equity in STEM education and research. These policies ensure that women have equal access to scholarships, research opportunities, and leadership roles. Project teams are also actively working to address systemic barriers in the workplace by developing re-integration programs for new mothers and women returning from career breaks, helping them re-enter the STEM workforce seamlessly.

Furthermore, project teams have scaled these support mechanisms beyond individual institutions, working with inter-university networks and regional bodies to ensure that women across different sectors and geographies receive the support they need to succeed. These efforts include the development of regional mentorship frameworks, scholarship programs, and gender awareness programs that create continuity in support as women move from education to the workforce. By ensuring coordinated action between educational institutions, advocacy groups, government agencies, and industry, we are building a seamless pathway for women to enter and thrive in STEM careers. 

### What's needed?
Investigate strategies to create a seamless support system that bridges education and workforce transitions for women in STEM. We must explore collaborative approaches among educational institutions, government agencies, and industry partners to implement gender-sensitive curricula, capacity-building initiatives, and re-integration programs. Future research needs to address the prevalence and impact of gender-based violence and discrimination in academic and professional settings, providing recommendations for fostering safe and supportive environments.
