  title: The initiative and our approach
  p1: IDRC funded the Breaking Barriers projects in 2020 to address this knowledge gap. The cohort of 10 studies analyzed trends of gendered participation in Southern science systems and the embedded systemic and systematic inequities that prevent women from advancing in a range of fields and sectors in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These studies generated evidence on the unique obstacles facing women and other marginalized groups in STEM in low-income countries.
  p2: Building on this pilot initiative, in 2021 funding was expanded for Gender in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (GIST or Gender in STEM).
  p3: By providing evidence on what works and grounded in the realities of women in low- and middle-income countries, we can create more equitable science systems that improve the lives of all.
  aim:
    title: The research aims to
    p1: Increase understanding of the barriers that prevent women from progressing in STEM fields 
    p2: Provide evidence on which strategies are most effective to break down those barriers in low- and middle-income countries 
    p3: Improve women’s leadership in science 
    p4: Integrate gender analysis as a standard component of scientific research
